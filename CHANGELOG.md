# VUI CHANGELOG

## 2025

### March

#### Tuesday 11th

- UI
	- We tried to make a first architecture using BGFX but, building the lib on MacOS is impossible. We submit an issue on BGFX GitHub repository and we are waiting for a response. It seems that there is no correct MacOS arm64 implementation of BGFX lib.
- Headset
	- We tried to build something with BGFX and move it to the headset and same as UI team, it seems to not work.
